* Introduction

A really small article to talk about small updates on the website (/well, maybe not that
small/). In a gist: a new css and articles changes.

- Updating the style of the website to something really similar to [[https://newcss.net/][new.css]]. It is way
  simpler and /pleasing/ (at least for me).
- My [[../articles][=/articles=]] are now exporting from my [[../articles/personal_knowledge_base.org][personal knowledge base]], powered by
  [[../articles/org_roam.org][=org-roam=]].
- A new [[https://dl.sbr.pm/][=/files=]] part is available, where I share some random file. See for example the
  [[https://dl.sbr.pm/wallpapers/dynamics/][dynamic wallpaper]] part.
