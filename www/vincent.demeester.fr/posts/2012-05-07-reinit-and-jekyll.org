* Introduction

Two weeks ago, my /online/ personal server has been attacked and,
somehow, died. I'm in the process of re-installation of it but I'm going
to hardened a bit the security on it. Anyway, this crash meant that
every piece of site I maintain has been down. That's why I moved this
/identity site/ on the github pages, using a CNAME ; That way I can
crash as much as I want my server(s), this page should still be up for a
while.

And I'm switching on Jekyll for this website as It is supported by
Github page, easy to use and easy to deploy elsewhere (if one day I want
to move from Github).

The rest of the post is going to be used as a /sandbox/ post to test the
site styles.
