This set of articles is my knowledge base. This is managed using [[file:org_mode.org][Org Mode]] and specifically
[[file:org_roam.org][org-roam]]. This content is kept up-to-date across time (compared to posts).

The following part of this page tries to present an organization to all my
articles ; but there is a [[file:sitemap.org][sitemap]] if you want to see all the content.
/The sitemap is gonna be a little bit hard to navigate without a filtering mechanism./
