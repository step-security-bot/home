The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation
— David Laing

There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good software
documentation: there isn’t one thing called documentation, there are four.

They are: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. They represent
four different purposes or functions, and require four different approaches to their
creation. Understanding the implications of this will help improve most documentation -
often immensely.

This is a set of resources around how setup a system to document your software/product
correctly. And there is *four* distinctive type of documentation (different style of writing):

- Tutorials — /learning-oriented/
  Usually the most important to "get-in", and usually not very well done.
- How-to Guides — /problem-oriented/
  Series of step required to solve a real-world problem.
- Explanation — /understanding-oriented/
- References — /information-oriented/

One very interesting part of this article is the template part of it:
- Beginning :: /What are you going to tell me/
