Have you ever seen someone write something to the effect of “I would use Go, but I need
generics”? Perhaps we can infer from this that many of the people who are pining after
generics in Go are not, in fact, Go users. Many of them are users of another programming
language that does have generics, and they feel that generics are a good fit for this
language, and therefore a good fit for any language. The inertia of “what I’m used to”
comes to a violent stop when they try to use Go. People affected by this frustration
interpret it as a problem with Go, that Go is missing some crucial feature - such as
generics. But this lack of features is itself a feature, not a bug.
