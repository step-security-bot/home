#+title: How I decide between many programming languages | Drew DeVault’s Blog

I have a few old standards in my toolbelt that I find myself calling upon most often, but
I try to learn enough about many programming languages to reason about whether or not
they’re suitable to any use-case I’m thinking about. The best way is to learn by doing,
so getting a general impression of the utility of many languages helps equip you with the
knowledge of whether or not they’d be useful for a particular problem even if you don’t
know them yet.
