* TODO Goals

* TODO Emacs

- Tramp aka local edit, remote execution
- ssh + emacs in terminal aka remote edit, remote execution

** TODO Challenges

- Tramp + direnv doesn't work
  + Actually it does with a little bit of "magic"
    =C-x p c= followed by =eval "$(direnv export bash)" && go build -v ./...= and it just
    works, it needs automation though.
- "Slowness"

Ideas:
- Use remote-tailored commands (write elisp)
- ko nix aware to be able to delegate to builder


* TODO Alternatives

- VSCode
- Vim
