A personal knowledge base is an electronic tool used to express, capture, and later
retrieve the personal knowledge of an individual. It differs from a traditional database
in that it contains subjective material particular to the owner, that others may not agree
with nor care about (From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base][Wikipedia]]).
