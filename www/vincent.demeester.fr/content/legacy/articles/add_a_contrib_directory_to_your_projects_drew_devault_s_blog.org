#+title: Add a “contrib” directory to your projects | Drew DeVault’s Blog

The contrib directory is used as an unorganized (or, at best, lightly organized) bin of
various useful things contributed by the community around the software, but which is not
necessarily a good candidate for being a proper part of the software. Things in contrib
should not be wired into your build system, shouldn’t be part of your automated testing,
shouldn’t be included in your documentation, and should not be installed with your
packages. contrib entries are not supported by the maintainers, and are given only a light
code review at the most. There is no guarantee whatsoever of workitude or maintenance for
anything found in contrib.
