#+TITLE: Containers

From the [[file:docker.org][Docker]] [[https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container][website]] :

#+begin_quote
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies
so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A
Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that
includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system
libraries and settings.
#+end_quote

[[file:docker.org][Docker]] made the use of [[file:linux.org][Linux]] containers easy, and bootstrap the [[file:open_container_initiative.org][Open Container Initiative]]
to ensure we have standards.

* Runtimes

There is a bunch of runtimes:
- [[file:runc.org][runc]] from [[file:open_container_initiative.org][OCI]] (simplest, default runtime)
- [[file:docker.org][docker]] from [[file:docker.org][Docker Inc.]]
- [[file:containerd.org][containerd]] under the [[file:moby_project.org][Moby Project]]
- [[file:cri_o.org][cri-o]] from [[file:red_hat.org][Red Hat]]

* Specs

- [[file:opencontainers_runtime_spec_oci_runtime_specification.org][opencontainers/runtime-spec: OCI Runtime Specification]]
- [[file:opencontainers_image_spec_oci_image_format.org][opencontainers/image-spec: OCI Image Format]]
- [[file:opencontainers_distribution_spec_oci_distribution_specification.org][opencontainers/distribution-spec: OCI Distribution Specification]]
