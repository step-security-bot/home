#+begin_quote
The Tekton Pipelines project provides [[file:kubernetes.org][Kubernetes]]-style resources for declaring [[file:continuous_integration.org][CI]]/[[file:continuous_deployment.org][CD]]-style pipelines.
#+end_quote

- Started as an experiment from [[file:knative.org][knative]] to define more advance build use cases that
  [[https://github.com/knative/build/][~knative/build~]] was able to.
- Is now it's own [[https://tekton.dev][project]] and [[https://github.com/tetkon][GitHub organization]].

It can be deployed in [[file:openshift.org][OpenShift]] either using the upstream releases or with [[file:openshift_pipeline.org][OpenShift
Pipeline]].

As it is running in [[file:kubernetes.org][Kubernetes]], everything runs into [[file:containers.org][containers]].

* TODO Guides

** TODO [[file:tekton-migrating-from-jenkins.org][Migrating from Jenkins to Tekton]]

The gist of this guide is to help you migrate from Jenkins (using =Jenkinsfile=, or not) to
Tekton pipelines.

** TODO Efficient Tekton Pipelines

* Contributing

- [[file:tekton_dev.org][Tekton development environment]] is a good /getting started/ article.
- [[https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/teps/README.md][Tekton Enhancement proposals (TEPs)]] are a good way to see what and how are the features
  discuss in the tekton community.

** Design Docs

Let's list some interesting design docs I worked on (or reviewed).

** TEPs : Tekton Enhancement Proposals

[2020-06-17 Wed] TEP, or Tekton Enhancement Proposal is a new process to to propose,
communicate and coordinate on new efforts for the Tekton project. You can read the full
details of the project in [[https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/teps/0001-tekton-enhancement-proposal-process.md][TEP-1]].

#+begin_quote
A standardized development process for Tekton is proposed in order to

- provide a common structure and clear checkpoints for proposing changes to Tekton
- ensure that the motivation for a change is clear
- allow for the enumeration stability milestones and stability graduation criteria
- persist project information in a Version Control System (VCS) for future Tekton users
  and contributors
- support the creation of high value user facing information such as:
  + motivation for impactful user facing changes
  + an overall project development roadmap
- ensure community participants are successfully able to drive changes to completion
  across one or more releases while stakeholders are adequately represented throughout the
  process

*This process is supported by a unit of work called a Tekton Enhancement Proposal (TEP)*. A
TEP attempts to combine aspects of the following:

- feature, and effort tracking document
- a product requirements document
- design document

into one file which is created incrementally in collaboration with one or more [[https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/working-groups.md][Working
Groups (WGs)]].

This process does not block authors from doing early design docs using any means. It does
not block authors from sharing those design docs with the community (during Working
groups, on Slack, GitHub, ….

This process acts as a requirement when a design docs is ready to be implemented or
integrated in the tektoncd projects. In other words, a change that impact other tektoncd
projects or users cannot be merged if there is no TEP associated with it.

This TEP process is related to

    the generation of an architectural roadmap
    the fact that the what constitutes a feature is still undefined
    issue management
    the difference between an accepted design and a proposal
    the organization of design proposals

This proposal attempts to place these concerns within a general framework.

The TEPs should be publish at https://teps.tekton.dev at some point.
