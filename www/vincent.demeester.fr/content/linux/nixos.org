#+title: NixOS
#+subtitle: A reproductible, declarative and reliable Linux operating system.

[[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and configuration
management. Built on top of the [[file:nix.org][Nix]] package manager, it is completely declarative, makes
upgrading systems reliable, and has many other [[https://nixos.org/features.html][advantages]].

Most of my infrastructure is on NixOS.
