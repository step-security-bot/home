* TODO Should the publish/export code be in =src/home=

A nice side effect would be that it can be used directly from emacs (no need to call =make=
from emacs). Otherwise, [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html#nicer-generated-heading][this]] will need to be adapted.

* TODO nixify publishing

See https://github.com/etu/etu.github.io/

* TODO [[https://abhinavsarkar.net/about/][About Me | abhinavsarkar.net]]
