The present document, referred to in the source code version as =emacs.org=, contains the
bulk of my configurations for GNU Emacs. It is designed using principles of "literate
programming": a combination of ordinary language and inline code blocks. Emacs knows how
to parse this file properly so as to evaluate only the elisp ("Emacs Lisp") included
herein. The rest is for humans to make sense of my additions and their underlying
rationale.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Literate programming allows us to be more expressive and deliberate. Not only we can use
typography to its maximum potential, but can also employ techniques such as internal links
between sections. This makes the end product much better for end users, than a terse
script.
#+END_QUOTE

I switched back and forth on using =org-mode= and literate programming, so why re-using
it. First, I think I went for it the wrong way the first time. I copied part of the
configuration from elsewhere, sometimes without really needing what I was copying. for
some reason I think this is a common pattern when configuring Emacs. You start by using a
distribution (Doom Emacs, Spacemacs, â€¦) or by copying configuration from all over the
place. Slowly but surely you realize this was a mistake as you didn't learn anything, so
you *reboot* your configuration.
