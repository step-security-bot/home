# What is `home`

This repository is the monorepo for my personal tools and infrastructure. It containers my
dotfiles, some tools and scripts. It is mainly based on `nix` and =home-manager=some shell
script and maybe sometimes ansible â€” especially on non-NixOS system.

The goal of is repository is to be able to have a way to setup dotfiles and packages in
*one go*, sharing those configuration between multiple computers. The documentation part
is using (or *will*) `org-mode` following principles of "literate programming": a
combination of ordinary language and inline code blocks.

On idea is also to try to do something like "[Leveraging disposability for exploration](https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/leveraging_disposability_for_exploration/)",
aka "how to play around without leaving a mess". I'll try my best to make everything
reproducible and easily testable without making *a mess*. Nix/NixOS should help with thatâ€¦

This will be a all-time work-in-progress, so please beware that things might change
dramatically or even not working anymore ðŸ˜›.

See [`./tasks.org`](./tasks.md) for the *work-in-progress* â€” and there is **a lot of work-in-progress**.

# TODO Installation

*todo: rework that part, link to the `docs` folder*

You should be able to run the `bootstrap.sh` script as is. And if you feel adventurous,
you can use `curl` for this.

    curl https://gitlab.com/vdemeester/home/-/raw/master/bootstrap.sh | sh

Otherwise, clone this repository somewhere, read the `bootstrap.sh` file and execute it if
you feel safe


<a id="h:62ee62f0-7e1a-4abc-b289-ac24d12e733c"></a>

## TODO `home-manager` only

*todo: rework that part*

If you don't have `nix` installed, run `curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh` to install it.

-   clone this repository in `$HOME/.config/nixpkgs`
-   create a \`home.nix\` file with the content you want.
    Some machines files already exists that you can use :
    
        { pkgs, ... }:
        
        {
          imports = [
            ./machines/hokkaido.nix
          ];
        }

-   run `nix-shell https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz -A install` (maybe twice :D)
-   run `home-manager switch;`

## TODO `nixos` only

*todo: rework that part*

# Organization of the repository

This is probably gonna be a moving target, but this is how it looks (or should look
soon-ish ðŸ‘¼):

-   `assets`: ignored folder where my *automation* puts some *secrets*.
    Most of the `make` commands will try to populate this ahead of time. The assumption is :
    have a `sync` folder where the assets are. *Note: how to bootstrap (as syncthing will
    not be there, and the `sync` folder either)*
-   `docs`: holds documentation about this code, literate configuration, see [literate configuration](#orgc18f61e).
    `make publish` will publish the `README.org` and the `docs` folder to my website.
-   `lib`: shared code used during configuration (mostly `nix` code).
-   `machines`: configuration per machines
-   `modules`: holds nix modules (services, programs, hardware, profiles, â€¦)
-   `overlays`: holds [nix overlays](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays)
-   `pkgs`: holds nix packages (those should migrate under `overlays` or on `nur-packages`)
-   `private`: holds non-shareable code, like *secrets*.
-   `tmp`: things toâ€¦ organize (e.g. where I import my other *legacy* configuration)

<a id="orgc18f61e"></a>As I'm slowly, but <span class="underline">surely</span>, going to have `org-mode` files for
literate configuration files in this repository, I have to think of how to organize files
in order to end up with one huge file. The goal of having those `org-mode` files, is
mainly to document my configuration and publish it, most likely on [sbr.pm](https://sbr.pm).
