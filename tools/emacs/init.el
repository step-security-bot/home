;; =use-package= is a tool that streamlines the configuration of packages. It handles
;; everything from assigning key bindings, setting the value of customisation options,
;; writing hooks, declaring a package as a dependency for another, and so on.
;; 
;; #+begin_quote
;; The =use-package= macro allows you to isolate package configuration in your =.emacs= file
;; in a way that is both performance-oriented and, well, tidy.  I created it because I have
;; over 80 packages that I use in Emacs, and things were getting difficult to manage.  Yet
;; with this utility my total load time is around 2 seconds, with no loss of functionality!
;; #+end_quote
;; 
;; With =use-package= we can improve the start-up performance of Emacs in a few fairly simple
;; ways. Whenever a command is bound to a key it is configured to be loaded only once
;; invoked. Otherwise we can specify which functions should be autoloaded by means of the
;; =:commands= keyword.
;; 
;; We need to setup the emacs package system and install =use-package= if not present
;; already.
