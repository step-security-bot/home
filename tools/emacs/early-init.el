;; 
;; Starting with Emacs 27, an =early-init.el= file can be used to do early configuration
;; and optimization.
;; 
;; #+begin_quote
;; Emacs can now be configured using an early init file. The file is called ~early-init.el~,
;; in ~user-emacs-directory~. It is loaded very early in the startup process: before
;; graphical elements such as the tool bar are initialized, and before the package manager is
;; initialized. The primary purpose is to allow customizing how the package system is
;; initialized given that initialization now happens before loading the regular init file
;; (see below).
;; 
;; We recommend against putting any customizations in this file that don't need to be set up
;; before initializing installed add-on packages, because the early init file is read too
;; early into the startup process, and some important parts of the Emacs session, such as
;; 'window-system' and other GUI features, are not yet set up, which could make some
;; customization fail to work.
;; #+end_quote
;; 
;; We can use this to our advantage and optimize the initial loading of emacs.
;; 
;; - Before Emacs 27, the init file was responsible for initializing the package manager by
;;   calling `package-initialize'.  Emacs 27 changed the default behavior: It now calls
;;   `package-initialize' before loading the init file.


(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)



;; - Let's inhibit resizing the frame at early stage.


(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)



;; - I never use the /menu-bar/, or the /tool-bar/ or even the /scroll-bar/, so we can safely
;;   disable those very very early.


(menu-bar-mode -1)
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
(horizontal-scroll-bar-mode -1)



;; - Finally we can try to avoid garbage collection at startup. The garbage collector can
;;   easily double startup time, so we suppress it at startup by turning up ~gc-cons-threshold~
;;   (and perhaps ~gc-cons-percentage~) temporarily.


(setq gc-cons-threshold 402653184
      gc-cons-percentage 0.6)



;; - Another small optimization concerns on =file-name-handler-alist= : on every .el and .elc
;;   file loaded during start up, it has to runs those regexps against the filename ; setting
;;   it to ~nil~ and after initialization finished put the value back make the initialization
;;   process quicker.


(defvar file-name-handler-alist-original file-name-handler-alist)
(setq file-name-handler-alist nil)



;;   However, it is important to reset it eventually. Not doing so will cause garbage
;;   collection freezes during long-term interactive use. Conversely, a ~gc-cons-threshold~
;;   that is too small will cause stuttering. This will be done at the end.
;; 
;; - It's also possible to put the theme *and* the font in =early-init.el= to speed the
;;   start.
