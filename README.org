#+TITLE: Home configuration files

* What is ~home~

This repository is using ~home-manager~ and ~nix~.

If you don't have ~nix~ installed, run ~curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh~ to install it.

- clone this repository in ~$HOME/.config/nixpkgs~
- create a `home.nix` file with the content you want.
  Some machines files already exists that you can use :

  #+begin_src nix
    { pkgs, ... }:

    {
      imports = [
        ./machines/hokkaido.nix
      ];
    }
  #+end_src

- run ~nix-shell https://github.com/rycee/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz -A install~ (maybe twice :D)
- run ~echo -n "Passphrase: "; read -i PASSPHRASE; env PASSPHRASE=$PASSPHRASE home-manager switch;~

* Goal

The goal of is repository is to be able to have a way to setup dotfiles and packages in
/one go/, sharing those configuration between multiple computers. The documentation part
is using (or /will/) =org-mode= following principles of "literate programming": a
combination of ordinary language and inline code blocks.

This means it could become the /monorepo/ of my configuration, slowly migrating other
repositories into this one (like [[https://github.com/vdemeester/emacs-config][~emacs-config~]]). This repository should be the source of
truth of all my configuration.

This will be a all-time work-in-progress, so please beware that things might change
dramatically or even not working anymore ðŸ˜›.
