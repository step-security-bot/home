#+TITLE: =home= monorepo
#+FILETAGS: #home infra configuration dotfiles

~home~ is the monorepo containing my personal tools and infrastructure. Everything in here
should be built using [[https://nixos.org/nix][Nix]].

* Highlights

It is meant to be fully reproducible (using [[https://github.com/nmattia/niv][niv]] for now) and position-independent, meaning
there is no moving around of ~configuration.nix~. For the configurations' entry points see
the individual [[file:systems][systems]], as well as [[file:default.nix][default.nix]].

This will be a all-time work-in-progress, so please beware that things might change
dramatically or even not working anymore ðŸ˜›.

** Systems

This holds the configuration of my different systems. It is meant to be
position-independent, meaning there is no moving around of ~configuration.nix~. For the
configurations' entry points see the individual [[file:systems][systems]], as well as [[file:default.nix][default.nix]].

** Tools

Those are tools I have written for my personal usage.

** User(s)

Users configuration, for [[https://nixos.org][NixOS]] and using home-manager.
