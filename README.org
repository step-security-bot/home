#+TITLE: =home= monorepo
#+FILETAGS: #home infra configuration dotfiles

~home~ is the monorepo containing my personal tools and infrastructure. Everything in here
should be built using [[https://nixos.org/nix][Nix]].

* Highlights

It is meant to be fully reproducible (using [[https://github.com/nmattia/niv][niv]] for now) and position-independent, meaning
there is no moving around of ~configuration.nix~. For the configurations' entry points see
the individual [[file:systems][systems]], as well as [[file:default.nix][default.nix]].

This will be a all-time work-in-progress, so please beware that things might change
dramatically or even not working anymore ðŸ˜›.

** =/systems=

This holds the configuration of my different systems. It is meant to be
position-independent, meaning there is no moving around of ~configuration.nix~. For the
configurations' entry points see the individual [[file:systems][systems]], as well as [[file:default.nix][default.nix]].

/Note: to test =flakes= use =nix build '.#nixosConfigurations.foo.config.system.build.toplevel'=, or even better, to test in a VM use =nix build '.#nixosConfigurations.foo.config.system.build.vm'=./

*** =/hosts=

This is the configuration for each hosts. It should be as simple as enabling some profiles
and some ad-hoc very specific configuration.

*** =/modules=

This is where all configuration that can be used across different system would lend. These
are not system dependent and should be configurable. This is following

*** =/profiles=

This is where profiles enable/disable and configure modules (defined in NixOS or in
here). Examples are `developement`, â€¦

** =/users=

Users configuration, for [[https://nixos.org][NixOS]] or not and using home-manager.

*** =/modules=

This is a list of modules that can be used by all users.

*** =/{users}/default.nix=

Contains NixOS user specific configuration. It gets imported if the user is listed in a
given configuration. It will contains the user creation information (groups, â€¦) and can
refer to a given home-manager configuration.

*** =/{users}/home.nix=

Contains home-manager configuration.
/Note/: In order to get information from Nixos, use =nixosConfig=. This should be useful to
configure some modules depending on the host configuration.

** =/nix=

Nix configurations, packages definitions, overlays.

** =/tools=

Those are tools I have written for my personal usage.

** =/www=

Website sources and builders/deployers.
